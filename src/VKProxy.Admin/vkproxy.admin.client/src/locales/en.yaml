FailureRateLimitTip:  default failure rate limit for a destination to be marked as unhealthy that is applied if it's not set on a cluster's metadata. The value is in range (0,1). Default is 0.3 (30%).
MinimalTotalCountThresholdTip: minimal total number of requests which must be proxied to a destination within the detection window before this policy starts evaluating the destination's health and enforcing the failure rate limit. Default is 10.
DetectionWindowSizeTip: period of time while detected failures are kept and taken into account in the rate calculation. Default is 60
ReactivationPeriodTip: period after which an unhealthy destination's passive health state is reset to Unknown and it starts receiving traffic again
